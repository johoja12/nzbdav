Based on the database analysis of the running container, here is the exact mapping for a real file currently in your system.

### 1. The "Source" File (Virtual WebDAV Item)
This is the virtual file NzbDav created from the NZB.

*   **Job Name:** `1.HAPPY.FAMILY.USA.S01E02.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-TURG`
*   **Category:** `sonarr`
*   **File Name:** `1.HAPPY.FAMILY.USA.S01E02.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-TURG.mkv`
*   **Internal ID:** `B61EAE44-92EB-4D0F-A495-0948FBA74B2B`
*   **Size:** 1.02 GB (1,020,035,530 bytes)

### 2. The Path Reported to Sonarr
When Sonarr asks "Where is my download?", NzbDav constructs this path based on your `import-strategy` (default: `symlinks`) and mount configuration.

*   **Configured Mount:** `/mnt/remote/nzbdav` (Derived from your prompt)
*   **Symlink Folder:** `completed-symlinks`
*   **Category:** `sonarr`
*   **Job Folder:** `1.HAPPY.FAMILY.USA.S01E02.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-TURG`

**Full Path Sonarr Sees:**
`/mnt/remote/nzbdav/completed-symlinks/sonarr/1.HAPPY.FAMILY.USA.S01E02.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-TURG/`

### 3. The File Inside That Path
Inside that folder, Sonarr finds:
`/mnt/remote/nzbdav/completed-symlinks/sonarr/1.HAPPY.FAMILY.USA.S01E02.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-TURG/1.HAPPY.FAMILY.USA.S01E02.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-TURG.mkv`

**How the Magic Works:**
This file is a **symlink** (technically an RClone link).
It points to the virtual WebDAV path:
`/content/sonarr/1.HAPPY.FAMILY.USA.S01E02.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-TURG/1.HAPPY.FAMILY.USA.S01E02.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-TURG.mkv`

When Sonarr "Imports" (moves) this file, it reads from this symlink. NzbDav intercepts the read, fetches the required segments from Usenet on-the-fly, decrypts/decodes them, and streams the bytes to Sonarr, which writes the final file to your media library.
